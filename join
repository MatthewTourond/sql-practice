The FROM clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the game table. The ON says how to figure out which rows in game go with which rows in goal - the id from goal must match matchid from game. (If we wanted to be more clear/specific we could say 

#1
Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'
    SELECT matchid, player FROM goal 
        WHERE teamid='GER'
        
#2
Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012
    SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
        FROM game WHERE id = '1012'
        
#3
Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.
    SELECT player,teamid,stadium,mdate
        FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
            where teamid = 'GER'

#4
Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'
    SELECT team1, team2, player FROM game
        join goal ON (id=matchid)
            where player like 'Mario%'
#5
Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10
    SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime FROM goal
        join eteam on teamid=id
            WHERE gtime<=10


#6
List the the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.
    SELECT mdate, teamname from game
        join eteam ON (team1=eteam.id)
            where coach = 'Fernando Santos'
#7
List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'
    SELECT player from goal
        join game on (matchid=id)
            where stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'
